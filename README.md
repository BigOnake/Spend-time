#Leisure Helper

Leisure Helper is a android mobile app that helps one to spend free-time.

##Goal and purpose of the app

This app has several purposes:

1. To learn about architecture of the app.
2. To practice how to work with APIs.
3. To improve knowledge of *Room* and *Retrofit*.
4. How to work with *Range seekbar* and *Bottom navigation bar*.

Creating this app gave me a lot of benefits.
I find out purposes of architecture.
I've learned how to work with database and room a little bit deeper.
I had to improve my programming and searching skills.
